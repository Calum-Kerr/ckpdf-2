                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        At RevisePDF, we take data protection seriously. This page outlines our approach to protecting your data and ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Data Protection Principles</h3>
                    <p>
                        We adhere to the following data protection principles:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:</strong> We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purpose limitation:</strong> We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and do not process it in a manner incompatible with those purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> We ensure that personal data is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage limitation:</strong> We keep personal data in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Integrity and confidentiality:</strong> We process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.</li>
