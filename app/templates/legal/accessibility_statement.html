                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        RevisePDF is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Conformance Status</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RevisePDF is partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.
                    </p>
