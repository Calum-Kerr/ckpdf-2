                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        At RevisePDF, we prioritize the security of your data and our systems. This page outlines our security practices and measures to protect your information when using our services.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Infrastructure Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our infrastructure is designed with security as a fundamental principle:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Secure hosting:</strong> We use reputable cloud service providers with robust security certifications and compliance programs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Network security:</strong> We implement firewalls, network segmentation, and intrusion detection systems to protect our infrastructure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> We regularly update our systems and applications with security patches to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> We continuously monitor our systems for suspicious activities and potential security threats.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Data Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        We implement multiple layers of protection for your data:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encryption in transit:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.</li>
                        <li><strong>Encryption at rest:</strong> We encrypt sensitive data stored in our databases and file storage systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Temporary storage:</strong> Files uploaded to our service are automatically deleted after processing or after a short period (typically 24 hours).</li>
                        <li><strong>Secure file handling:</strong> We use secure random filenames and strict path validation to prevent path traversal attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> We implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of our services and protect against denial-of-service attacks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Access controls:</strong> We implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorised personnel can access sensitive data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Application Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our application is developed with security best practices:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Secure development:</strong> We follow secure coding practices and conduct regular code reviews.</li>
                        <li><strong>Input validation:</strong> We validate all user inputs to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication and authorisation:</strong> We implement secure authentication mechanisms and proper authorisation checks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Content Security Policy:</strong> We use a strict Content Security Policy to prevent cross-site scripting attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities.</li>

                        <li><strong>Security headers:</strong> We implement various security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security testing:</strong> We regularly perform security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.</li>
                    </ul>
