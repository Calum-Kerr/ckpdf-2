# Hi there, I'm Calum Kerr ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a student at Edinburgh Napier University, working on projects that blend practical tools with engaging experiences.

## RevisePDF

[RevisePDF](https://www.revisepdf.com/) is a comprehensive PDF manipulation web application that lets users optimise, convert, edit, organise, and secure PDF documents through an intuitive interface.

## Future Development Focus

I'm currently focused on three key areas of development:

### 1. Supabase Integration
- Enhancing user authentication with Google OAuth
- Implementing user profiles and document storage
- Setting up usage tracking for subscription tiers

### 2. Marketing & User Growth
- Improving SEO to increase organic traffic
- Developing targeted marketing campaigns
- Building community through user feedback integration

### 3. Tool Completion
- Finalising the WYSIWYG PDF editor (currently marked as "coming soon")
- Completing the text editor with advanced formatting options
- Implementing additional security features

## Technology

Built with Python/Flask, PyMuPDF, and Supabase, with plans to migrate the frontend to Vue.js.
